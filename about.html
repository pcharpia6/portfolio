                        I am a MERN full-stack developer specializing in APIs and database queries.
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        In each of the group projects in the UNCH Coding Bootcamp, I took the role 
                        of building routes and managing the database(s).
                    </p>
                    <h4>
                        I am a problem solver.

                    <p>
                        Few things are more gratifying than applying 
                        my full attention to a particularly challenging task to the point 
                        of resolution. In addition - a long term project coming together 
                        one piece at a time can be really enjoyable to watch grow. These 
                        are both qualities of software development which drew me to learn. 
                        I now want to make a career change and become full-time invested in 
                        these endeavors.

                        I am a learner.

                        Often, the most gratifying challenges to overcome are learning 
                        new things. Taking this class on Web Development is certainly 
                        filling that need right now, but the desire does not stop there. 
                        I constantly seek out new things to learn at home and at work to 
                        keep growing myself personally and professionally.

                        I met my wife on the dating website <em>E-Harmony</em> in 2013. 
                        We made such a good team that we married in the summer of 2015. 
                        We soon decided that our team was so awesome that it needed to grow, 
                        and in 2016 we received a wonderful baby boy whose energy and joy 
                        are the perfect way to end any tough day.
